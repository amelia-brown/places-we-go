#### What it does

A simple client-side app that uses Google Places Api to search for and
save places.

It was built with:
+ React
+ Redux
+ Webpack
+ Babel
+ Sass

#### Considerations

The main goals of this project were to quickly search and view a
location, have the ability to save and delete searched locations, and
persist the state locally between sessions.

Another consideration was the interface, which uses simple,
straightforward components with intuitive interactions.

I decided to use google's default map styles, since those are the most
familliar and predictable.

#### Get started

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`open index.html`

or

`npm start`

will open on port 8080 using http-server
